### Process
I thought the task was fun to implement because I have not used drag and drop so much before. An important decision I made at the beginning of the implementation was to use blank pictures that change places with the puzzle pieces. It was advantageous in a way because each place gets a unique ID that is easy to keep track of. However, there may be a better and more time-efficient way to do it. In retrospect, when I look at the code, I have thought a lot about filling an array with 12 blank images. It could have been done in a different way, but as I said, it became easier to implement.

Considering that the estimated time to spend on the exercise was three hours, I am satisfied with the result overall. It took about three hours to get everything to work but then I putted some time into styling and small features.

### Foucus area
I chose to focus on a simple and plain design. Another thing I chose was that the player sees the number of moves and time. After the puzzle is solved, the user gets a "confirm box" with the number of moves and the time it took. The last thing i did at the end was to make it responsive for mobile devices.
